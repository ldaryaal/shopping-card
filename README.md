# 🛒 Simple Shopping Card with Vanilla JS

Hi! This is a **practice project** I made while learning JavaScript.  
It’s a basic **shopping card** (like adding courses to a basket) using only **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and a bit of **CSS**.  
I used this project to practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, and working with Local Storage.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to add and remove items from the card (shopping basket).
- How to store data in Local Storage so it stays after refreshing the page.
- How to update the page dynamically using JavaScript.
- Also tried to fix some bugs like removing only **one instance of a course**, not all of them.

## ⚙️ Features

- Add courses to the shopping card.
- Remove **one course at a time**.
- Remove all courses at once.
- The courses stay in the card even after refreshing the page (thanks to Local Storage).
